# beats-quickstart
Makes getting started with [Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) easy!

## Steps
- Run `make beats-quickstart`. This is the last time you will run this.
- Done! That's it! Have fun with [Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats)!

## Details on What Happens via Steps
- Your `beats` repo clone, a directory below this, will now come with the proper Go setup to work, and a `.env` file placed in it.
- This top-level directory will host a mostly-self-contained Go install, leveraging `gvm`.
- You can now work in the `beats` folder and ignore this quickstart repo. 

# Important Notes
Don't forget to `source .env` once your IDE has the beats project open!
